== Description ==

[Drip](https://www.getdrip.com) is email marketing automation that doesn't suck. It's
the easiest way to get started with email marketing on WordPress, from building your email 
list to engaging your subscribers through an email mini-course.

It's likely that you've been looking for a WordPress plugin for email marketing but
have been overwhelmed by the choices. Drip is the future of email marketing software,
and this plugin makes installing it on WordPress a one-click operation.

With Drip you can easily send emails to your prospects, trial users and customers based on their
behavior. Using tags and events you can segment your users and send emails that are highly
focused and personalized based on their past interactions with your website or web application.

The first step to setting up Drip is to install a snippet of JavaScript in the footer 
of your website, and this plugin makes that dead simple for our customers who run WordPress.
